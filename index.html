 <h3> Hi, I'm Jamien </h3><br>
    <p>I'm a software developer living in Raleigh, North Carolina <br>
    I live in Raleigh, but I'm originally from Louisville Kentucky. I'm a current student at <a href="http://https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a><br>
    I decided to start coding because:
    <ol><br>
      <li>I love creating new things</li>
      <li>I wanted to learn a fun new skill</li>
      <li>I wanted to start a new career in tech</li>
      </ol></p>
<!-- about me here -->
      <br><br><br><hr>
      <h3>About me:</h3>
      <p>After spending 9 years in the beverage industry managing and consulting for craft cocktail bars accross the country, I decided to leave that field behind, and study to become a software programer. I love cocktails, but I've also found I really enjoy designing projects. <br>
      As a new student of Thinkful, I've started my jounrey as a software engineer after self learning on my own for a bit during the covid-19 pandemic.
